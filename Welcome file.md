1.  **Bug Fix: E-comm code redemption is not working**  - While providers can create a time-bound e-commerce code, the redemption API is currently rejecting such codes as invalid. This issue is classified as P2 or medium priority, as the affected feature is not currently in use.
    
2.  **Bug Fix: Return retailer email_domain in live retailer API**  - Currently, the live retailer API does not provide the retailer identity, which is necessary for manufacturers to apply retailer restrictions in MOF. Therefore, adding the retailer identity in the API is required.
