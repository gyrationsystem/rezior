**Add an optional description field in funder**

This becomes particularly valuable when one brand acquires another, providing a clear means of differentiation between the funder and the acquired entity through the utilization of descriptive attributes.

**Ability to mark a funder a test funder**

On certain occasions, manufacturers may need to assess an 8112 coupon in a production environment using a mock funder ID. This flag allows manufacturers to designate the funder as a test entity, ensuring its invisibility to the clearinghouse.
