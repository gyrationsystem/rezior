#### The Coupon Bureau® Provider API

Provider APIs allow a coupon provider to deposit/ delete a serialized GS1 (the GS1 distributed to a consumer) at the time of distribution into a manufacturer’s TCB account. These APIs are required for a provider to participate with TCB. Note: A provider will only be able to deposit serialized GS1s into Master Offer Files of those manufacturers who have authorized them.
